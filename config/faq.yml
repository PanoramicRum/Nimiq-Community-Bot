 answer: "The Luna Testnet is a demonstration of what's possible with Nimiq's unique Browser-based approach. The Testnet lets you mine, receive and send transactions in your Browser just by opening a [webpage](https://nimiq.com/miner). Luna is the second version of our Testnet. You can learn more about it [here](https://medium.com/nimiq-network/introducing-luna-fa0a845fd33e). The NIM you mine or transact in the Testnet are Luna NIM. **Luna NIM hold no intrinsic value and are used only for testing.**"

 answer: "NIM will be the token used in the Nimiq Blockchain. The Nimiq Blockchain is still under development (have a look at our current Testnet [here](https://nimiq.com/miner)). Before we launch the final version of the Nimiq Blockchain we will provide an easy-to-use web application to swap your NET for NIM at a rate of 10 NET = 1 NIM. This application will let you create a wallet in the Nimiq Blockchain, respective NIM will be added to that address in the Genesis Block."

 answer: "The team is currently based in a secluded coworking space in Costa Rica, where Robin Linus conceived the original design of the Nimiq Blockchain.\nThe team is formed mostly by German Developers and a couple of Costarrican Engineers. We also have offices in Germany too since a lot of our team is based there and having our team work in different timezones enable us to get work done around the clock.\n

 answer: "The parameters of the Nimiq Blockchain are:\n-Block time: 1 minute (inspired by the results of On the Security and Performance of Proof of Work Blockchains).\n-Block reward: starts with 5 Nimiq (NIM); halves every ~2'100'000 blocks. This approach models Bitcoin's approaccnh, while taking into account that Nimiq's block time is 10 times faster.\n-Max Block size: 1 MB\n-Difficulty adjustment: Every 10 blocks\n-Ttotal supply: 21 Mio Coins divisible by 10^8 just like Bitcoin)\nNote that these are the current parameters of the Testnet. The parameters for the MainNet will be adapted based on the gained experience from the Testnet."
